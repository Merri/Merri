I love Astro and any other new framework which ditches throwing client-side executed JavaScript at every problem.

The things I do tend to be ahead of the curve, sometimes by years. Which means I'm two things: a continuous learner and autistic.

Currently working on `vr.fi`, contributed a lot to the Junat kartalla service.

A lot of my stuff here on GitHub has now been outdated by the changing times. For example no more need for `react-lazy` since you can just do `<img loading="lazy" />`. What can we learn from this? JavaScript code for the front-end becomes outdated, but HTML and CSS keep on living. Maybe we should work more on just HTML and CSS, and less on JS since it is the short-lived solution until standards make things possible without JS.
