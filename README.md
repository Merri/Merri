### Heya ðŸ‘‹

I'm a guy who when put to work on a website will do work that seems mostly "invisible". However user happiness keeps going up while I work on the site.

Currently working on `vr.fi`, previously worked on creating a new `verkkokauppa.com` site and checkout.

Outside work and programming I'm interested in:

- Localizing games to Finnish! (Best language ever.)
- Fantasy stuff: world and story building
- Retro PC building
- Commodore 64 stuff
- Modding games

Also would love to get started with a game. Turn based strategy mixing Heroes III, Total War, Final Fantasy, and the Settlers II.
