## Hello ðŸ‘‹

Me? A programmer with ~20 years hobbyist, and 10+ years professional experience.<br>
Gone through various platforms and multiple languages, like VB, C, PHP, SQL, React.<br>
I love to specialize in web front-end. User experience and web standards first.<br>

My magic touch? User happiness goes up on every site I work on.<br >
(Also correlates with conversion metrics, but human metrics are more desirable.)

I'm also autistic, so I fight the battle of getting my message across to the neurotypical majority.<br>
My thinking is different, what some would call "innovative", sometimes years ahead of the curve.

Currently working on `vr.fi`, contributed a lot to the Junat kartalla service.

### Current stuff you might be interested of

I have multiple GitHub projects on [Astro](https://astro.build):

- [Mellon](https://github.com/Merri/mellon.kontu.me) (SSR!)
- [Settlers II.net](https://github.com/Merri/settlers2) (needs to be SSR'd at some point)
- [Merri.net](https://github.com/Merri/merri.net)

A lot of my stuff here on GitHub has now been outdated by the changing times. For example no more need for `react-lazy` since you can just do `<img loading="lazy" />`. What can we learn from this? JavaScript code for the front-end becomes outdated, but HTML and CSS keep on living. Maybe we should work more on just HTML and CSS, and less on JS since it is the short-lived solution until standards make things possible without JS.

Outside work and programming I'm interested in:

- Cycling. I have an old cheap bicycle, and a cargo bike.
- Localizing stuff to Finnish!
- PC building (retro & modern)
- Nintendo
- Fantasy stuff: world and story building
- Commodore 64
- Modding games

And during summer I sometimes do garden stuff.
