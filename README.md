### Heya ðŸ‘‹

I'm a guy who when put to work on a website will do work that seems mostly "invisible".<br>
However user happiness keeps going up while I work on the site.

Currently working on `vr.fi`, previously worked on creating a new `verkkokauppa.com` site and checkout.

Outside work and programming I'm interested in:

- Localizing games to Finnish! (Best language ever.)
- Fantasy stuff: world and story building
- Retro PC building
- Commodore 64 stuff
- Modding games

Also would love to get started with a game. Turn based strategy mixing Heroes III, Total War, Final Fantasy, and the Settlers II.

Btw: most of my stuff here on GitHub has now been outdated by the changing times. For example no much need for `react-lazy` since you can just do `<img loading="lazy" />`.
