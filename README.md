### Heya ðŸ‘‹

Me? A programmer with ~20 years hobbyist, and 8+ years professional experience.<br>
Gone through various platforms and multiple languages.<br>
I love to specialize in web front-end. User experience first, web standards first.<br>
If you can solve it without JavaScript, you should solve it without JavaScript.<br>
Hot take: I've had to write way more JS/TS than I should during past ~5 years.

Most of what I do is "invisible". Sites I work on see user happiness go up.

Currently working on `vr.fi`, previously worked on creating a new `verkkokauppa.com` site and checkout.

Outside work and programming I'm interested in:

- Localizing games to Finnish! (Best language ever.)
- Fantasy stuff: world and story building
- Retro PC building
- Commodore 64 stuff
- Modding games

Also would love to get started with a game. Turn based strategy mixing Heroes III, Total War, Final Fantasy, and the Settlers II.

Btw: most of my stuff here on GitHub has now been outdated by the changing times. For example no much need for `react-lazy` since you can just do `<img loading="lazy" />`. What can we learn from this? JavaScript code in Front-end becomes outdated, but HTML and CSS keep on living. Maybe we should work more on just HTML and CSS, and less on JS since it is the short-lived solution until standards make things possible without JS.
